/// 1. apply FOV scaling (respecting no_rot / no_scale labels)
/// 2. compute labels for each ADC
/// 3. compute soft delays (takes arbitrary input vars!)
/// 4. unify rel. and offset freq / phase using larmor frequency
/// 5. apply the rotation extension
/// 6. store `Once` and `Pmc` flags as well as triggers in the blocks
/// 7. unifying shims stored directly in the RF
